ROGUE with ncurses library    
*********************************************

*********************************************
Compiling the program
*********************************************

    On the terminal in the root directory(a2),
    type 'make'. You should see 'gcc -Wall -ansi
    src/rogue.c src/roguefunctions.c  
    -o bin/rogue -Iinclude -lncurses'. That means
    that the program has compiled.


*********************************************
Running the program
*********************************************

    To run the program, you should be on the
    terminal in the root directory(a2) already,
    then type 'cd bin' to change to the 
    binary folder. Then type './rogue rooms.txt' to enter
    the program, where rooms.txt is the input file with 
    the rooms in it(the file 'rooms.txt' must be in the 
    bin folder to work). Use the i,j,k,l keys to move. 
    Press 'n' to teleport to next room and 'q' 
    to exit the program and return to the
    terminal command line.

*********************************************
Known limitations
*********************************************

    In the input file 'rooms.txt', the dimensions
    should alway be immediatly proceeded by an object 
    such as treasure or a monster signified by 't','m' etc.
    and not by info for a door.

    ex. like this 10X6 t5,2........

        and not like this 10X6 de7.....
    
    Door elements can be in any other order except for being
    the first after the dimensions as stated above.
    (then can technically and the room will still work but if
    each line is read in with the door elements immediatly after
    the dimensions there will be a weird bug and you won't
    be able to play the game, so its best to start with 
    another element)
